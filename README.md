# Hello World 👋

My name is Mohamed, and I'm building my career in **Linux, Cloud, and DevOps**.  
I'm currently preparing for the **RHCSA certification**, and after that I aim to continue toward the **RHCE inshaAllah**.

I already hold **two AWS certifications** (AWS CLF & AWS SAA), and I'm expanding my skills through hands-on labs, scripting, Git, and web fundamentals.

This repository marks the beginning of my journey on GitHub — a place where I will store projects, labs, and everything I learn along the way.

### 🚀 What I'm Learning
- Linux (RHEL, RHCSA → RHCE inshaAllah)
- Git & GitHub
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Cloud & DevOps  (AWS)

### 🎯 My Goal
To become a strong DevOps & Cloud Engineer, build real projects, and keep improving myself every day.

Thanks for checking out my first repo!
